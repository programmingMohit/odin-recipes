    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A toasted sandwich, grilled cheese sandwich, cheese toastie, or grilled cheese
        is a hot sandwich (toastie) made with one or more varieties of cheese
        (a cheese sandwich) on bread. It is typically prepared by heating one or more
        slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter,
        on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the
        cheese melts.
    </p>
    <p>A grilled cheese may contain ingredients besides the bread and cheese, as long
        as the latter is the main focus.
